## Humanager

A small React project designed to augment my understanding of React, Redux, Redux thunk and Redux saga.
Currently limited to simple create/edit/delete behaviors with a focus on architecture. UI styling is next, and then features evolution.

# Dependencies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
